## Installation Tools

The tools that you will need to have set up are below. Follow along with the
install instructions in the `.md` files in this folder, and install
these in the following order:

* [Anaconda](./anaconda.md): manages a python installation for data scientists, ensuring that we have the right packages.  [See their website](https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda) for more information
* [git](./git.md): version control software that makes collaborative coding easier.  [See their website](https://git-scm.com/) for more information
* [Atom](./atom.md): our preferred text editor made and maintained by the fine folks at github.  [See their website](https://atom.io/docs/v0.191.0/getting-started-installing-atom) for more information
* [GitHub](https://github.com/): there's no `.md` file for this because in reading this README.md you have hopefully already set it up

The goal of this introduction is to assist you with getting these items up
and running. If you don't get them all installed before the first class,
please come a half hour early so that we can help you get them installed.
