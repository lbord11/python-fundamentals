# Installing Atom

This installation isn't as involved as Anaconda. You just need to navigate
to the [Atom](https://atom.io/docs/v0.191.0/getting-started-installing-atom) site and download the version of Atom corresponding to your operating system (Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux).

## Mac Users

Once you are done installing it, a window should pop up that allows you to
move it into your applications folder. I suggest doing that, and then
also putting it down in your dock for easy access, or creating a desktop
shortcut.

If you would like to be able to open files with Atom directly from the command
line you should click `Atom > Install Shell Commands` at which point you will
be prompted to enter your password.

## Linux Users
For Ubuntu, go to [https://atom.io/](https://atom.io) and click on the Debian (.deb)
package to download it into your Downloads folder.  Then, in terminal, navigate to
your Downloads folder and then type

```bash
sudo dpkg -i atom-amd64.deb
```
In this case the downloaded .deb file was *atom-amd64.deb* but change it in above bash
command if your file was different (as it may be for the 32 bit version).

## Windows Users

Once you are done installing it, double check that it works by opening the
Atom editor. I suggest creating a desktop shortcut for Atom or pinning
it to you taskbar for easy access. We'll be using it a lot.
